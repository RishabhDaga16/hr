        Hrishita Thakkar(20) is a resident of Kolkata studying at The Bhawanipur
        Educational Society, Calcutta (BESC) whereas Rishabh Daga(20) is
        currently staying at Hyderabad to pursue his U.G. degree at BITS Pilani,
        Hyderabad Campus. Hrishita and Rishabh have been in a semi-long distance
        relationship for 3 years now and are the cutest couple you'll ever come
        across on the internet. Both of them are very attractive and have great
        personalities but Rishabh is hotter than Hrishita, lol. (P.S. We're
        Sorry Hrishita, Rishabh asked us to write this and also, it's true,
        lmao.)
