        Hrishita and Rishabh first met at Zone Cafe, Kolkata on 28th October,
        2019 through their mutual friends. Rishabh was left speechless as soon
        as he saw Hrishita for the first time and developed a sense of
        attraction towards her. But, sadly he couldn't do anything about it at
        that time because both Hrishita and Rishabh were dating other people
        back then.
